	         <p> Bonjour! My name is Sarah and I am a young developer based in Colorado USA. I enjoy playing games and creating websites for the greater good. I would love to help any organization build out their website especially if it involves education and mental health issues. </p>
			 <br>
	         <p>
		        Being young I am stronger in the Front-end Development but have a great interest in expanding my knowledge to the Back-end Development. Git is my friend until i breaks. I specialize in Javascript + HTML + CSS. I have worked with React.js Angurlar 2 Vue.js and more. Throw me any framework or language I'll be sure to pick it up quickly by pouring all my efforts in whats needed.

			        <p>My main goal is to help others. I happen to do that through technology and film. All programs essentially make life easier which makes the user happy. (theoretically). My dream is to create a non profit organization to spread awareness to mental health. I believe that counseling/therapy is essential. We are losing our human touch and talking to a professional is something that should be accessible to anyone. Through technology I hope to connect others and create a community built on building others up. It's a small world yet so many people feel alone. Through film I hope to create emotion and inspiration. I believe film is an emotional get away. You feel what the character feels and it releases emotions you didn't even know you had! I hope to be an inspiration in films and make others happy through my craft. This is my work. </p>
