	        <hr>
	         <p> I enjoy thinking about how others think. I love thinking of the experience they will have using anything I create or do. I am an actress who thinks of her audience as her character and I am a programmer who thinks of how to make her user's life easier. I've done HTML and CSS when myspace was a big thing, (does anyone miss myspace?). I worked with what little technology I was allowed to use. (I'm the little sister out of 8 kids.). The web was always an enjoyable place for me, I grew up thinking how amazing it was to talk to people around the world just from my parents living room. I grew up acting singing doing good in school and then went to University not really knowing what I want to do. (Not to mention an empty wallet). From there I joined a Coding Bootcamp where I truly dove head first into the tech world. Not going to lie I was drowning at first but from there I learned the MEAN stack and really what programming is. It's not just memorization and math, it's a power of building comfort for people. </p>

	         <p>
		         I wrote a lot I'll hopefully make this shorter because who wants to read this wall of text about a stranger! But really, with learning frontend development to backend development I really love the thought of creating programs. Everything is made to make life easier, or harder if you're mean but I guess that makes it easier to be meaner!

			        <p>My main goal is to help others. I happen to do that through technology and film. All programs essentially make life easier which makes the user happy. (theoretically). My dream is to create a non profit organization to spread awareness to mental health. I believe that counseling/therapy is essential. We are losing our human touch and talking to a professional is something that should be accessible to anyone. Through technology I hope to connect others and create a community built on building others up. It's a small world yet so many people feel alone. Through film I hope to create emotion and inspiration. I believe film is an emotional get away. You feel what the character feels and it releases emotions you didn't even know you had! I hope to be an inspiration in films and make others happy through my craft. This is my work. </p>
